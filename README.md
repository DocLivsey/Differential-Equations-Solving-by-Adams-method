> - ### In Numerical Methods Lib, fully automate the process of running the program through files:
>> 1. add the ability to add the main directory for the configuration file (the process architecture will still be reviewed)
   add an API to work with .txt
>> 2. consider API options for working via .xml and .json
> - ### Revise the implementation of the numerical solution of Cauchy problems, boundary value problems and partial differential equations:
>> 1. write a general class that describes differential equations (preferably inheritance from the equations java class from the Numerical Methods Lib)
>> 2. prescribe the architecture of classes for systems and ordinary equations (general and special cases)
>> 3. connect the boundary value problem with the Cauchy problem (think about inheritance or use of a general diffur class)
